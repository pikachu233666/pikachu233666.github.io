Speaking of how I knew him, I had to take a long-distance running test during my senior high. In order to pass the test, I started to practice every morning with my earphones on, and I listened to Charlie’s songs by chance. As a singer, he usually posts some videos of his singing songs. People who like him are mostly impressed by his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. He always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people’s wounds with the power of love. He also used to post videos about his charity concerts, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of his fans.

Therefore, when we are together, we tend to talk about Charlie, as we are mostly impressed his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. Once Charlie held a charity concert, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas. As his fans, we decided to go together. It was also due to that charity concert that Olivia became a close friend of mine. As I found that she not only attended this concert to support Charlie, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas. After that, I often hang out with her, going shopping or trying some tasty food together. Knowing that Olivia is a really socially responsible and caring person, I enjoy spending time with her.  </p><h1 id="地点"><a href="#地点" class="headerlink" title="地点"></a>地点</h1><h3 id="Describe-a-quiet-place-you-like-to-go"><a href="#Describe-a-quiet-place-you-like-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Describe a quiet place you like to go"></a>Describe a quiet place you like to go</h3><p><strong>You should say: Where it is How you knew it How often you go there What you do there And explain how you feel about the place</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about Tokyo, which is a quiet place worth to go although it is the capital of Japan. It was the summer holiday in 2019 that I went there for travelling. Among all the attractions I visited in Tokyo, the fuji mountain, which is located at the suburban area, left me a deep impression. Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. It was surprising that the deep forest had existed for up to thousands of years and every tree is tall and strong. After seeing many kinds of the rare plants, I thought the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live(habitat).

After a few days, i could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, I needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. My father first demostrated how to do that, which set a good example for me, but he later threw me into the center of the swimming pool and asked me to swim back to the ground.

This is very effective for me to keep fit and healthy. Actually, I barely worked out before that, as I always worried that exercising too often might take lots of time that could have be used to study. But several months ago, I had to see a doctor for my back pain, which has already made me not able to concentrate on my work. Because of this, my best friend, Olivia, started to persuade me to go swimming with her in our spare time. So, since then, I have been swimming with Olivia. The place where we go swimming the most is a big swimming pool that was recently built near our apartment. It has a really good location because it is next to the city center. We usually go swimming there about two or three times a week. We also like to go to some other swimming pools to attend the swimming competition on weekends and challenge ourselves.

In the south of china, people also use meat as the filling for sticky rice dumplings. I tried this traditional food for the first time when I was 7. At that time, my family gathered together at lantern festival. And we had a big dinner in that evening, whose main course was sticky rice dumplings, as there is a custom in china that people should have sweet dumpling on lantern festival. It was very sticky, which was my first impression about sweet dumplings. But it was not only delicious/tasty, but also made us feel warm and happy because sweet dumpling has a similar pronunciation in Chinese to “Tuanyuan”, meaning reunion, which represents harmony and happiness for the family.The spirits of the product is beautiful.</p><h1 id="电影"><a href="#电影" class="headerlink" title="电影"></a>电影</h1><h3 id="Describe-a-program-you-like-to-watch"><a href="#Describe-a-program-you-like-to-watch" class="headerlink" title="Describe a program you like to watch"></a>Describe a program you like to watch</h3><p><strong>You should say:<br>What it is<br>What it is about<br>Who you watch it with<br>And explain why you like to watch it</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about my favorite program movie recommand, which is recommanding the high quanlity movie to the audience once a week, last week it recommanded a movie called the sound of music.

I was told to learn breast strokeby my coach, as this is the easiest one to learn. He asked me to lie on the ground first, and simulate/imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, i could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, I needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. The coach first demonstrated how to do that, which set a good example for me, after a few minutes of practice, i managed this skill. With days of practice, i could swim faster and further.

The camera is a device you can use to record the scenes into images. All people need to do is to point the lens to the things you want to catch and press the button, then people can get a clear picture of it. Nowadays, cameras are small and light that can be taken to anywhere easily, which allows people to record their lives whenever and wherever they want. For the young people, they can explore the world by using the camera to record the items they are interested in, which can increase their curiosity toward the world, stimulate their innovative spirit. For the middle-aged people, they can take photos of their products/creation, and make it into advertisements to increase the sale of them, which can help them earn more money. Some of them also like to tour all over the world and record the rare phenomenon. For the older people, photos taken by the cameras can remind them of the old memories. Cameras really make it efficient and accurate for people to record their own growth, which has changed the world positively.</p><h3 id="Describe-a-house-or-an-apartment-you-would-like-to-live-in"><a href="#Describe-a-house-or-an-apartment-you-would-like-to-live-in" class="headerlink" title="Describe a house or an apartment you would like to live in"></a>Describe a house or an apartment you would like to live in</h3><p><strong>You should say: What it is like Where it would be Why you would like to live in this house/apartment And how you feel about this house/apartment</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to live in a relatively small apartment in the future. As I am going to live alone, small apartment seems to be suitable for me, and the burden of housework will not be very heavy. I would like it to be located in the city center, since it will be convenient to go shopping to buy daily necessities. The apartment only needs to have one bedroom, but I hope that it can have a large desk for me to put three computer monitors, which will satisfy my requirement of programming. I also want to have a big balcony in my apartment so that I can spend time in the fresh air to keep healthy and have a pleasant mood. For the living room, it needs to have a treadmill and a television with big screen. As I prefer simple living environment, the overall style of decoration will tend to be concise_（简约的)_ and graceful. The apartment I just mentioned is just what I aspire, it can help me live a fulfilling life, and I will definitely feel delighted and comfortable to live in such an apartment.</p><h3 id="Describe-a-time-you-used-your-cellphone-smartphone-to-do-something-important"><a href="#Describe-a-time-you-used-your-cellphone-smartphone-to-do-something-important" class="headerlink" title="Describe a time you used your cellphone/smartphone to do something important"></a>Describe a time you used your cellphone/smartphone to do something important</h3><p><strong>You should say: What happened When it happened How important the cellphone/smartphone was And explain how you felt about the experience</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about my experience which happened in Tokyo, which is the capital of Japan. It was the summer holiday in 2019 that I went there for travelling. Among all the<br>attractions I visited in Tokyo, the fuji mountain, which is located at the suburban area, left me a deep impression. On the way to the fuji mountain, I did not know the way to get there because of I am a foreigner, so I used my phone to located where it is. With the help of the map on my phone, I eventually get there. Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing, thanks to the tips on my phone, I prepared a clothes before climbing the fuji mountain. I thought the smartphone is a treasure of the era and human beings, it not only provides convenient service, but also gives us many useful information.</p><h3 id="Describe-an-occasion-that-you-lost-something"><a href="#Describe-an-occasion-that-you-lost-something" class="headerlink" title="Describe an occasion that you lost something"></a>Describe an occasion that you lost something</h3><p><strong>You should say: What you lost When and where you lost it What you did to find it And explain how you felt about it</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about an experience that I lost an important thing, which is camera. The camera is a device you can use to record the scenes into images. All I need to do is to point the lens to the things I want to catch and press the button, then I can get a clear picture of it. Last month, when I climbed mountain in the morning at that day, my camera accidentally dropped down to the mountain. To find it, I went down to the bottom of mountain and walk around, but found nothing. So I called the keeper of the mountain to help me. After one day, They called me said that they found my camera with the lens broken. We thanked the keeper and repaired the camera. The data in camera records important memories of my growth, I really surprised I could find it again.</p>]]></content>

It was the summer holiday in 2019 that I went there for travelling. Among all the attractions I visited in Tokyo, the fuji mountain, which is located at the suburban area, left me a deep impression. Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. It was surprising that the deep forest had existed for up to thousands of years and every tree is tall and strong. After seeing many kinds of the rare plants, I thought the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live(habitat). I learn a lot of knowledge in this trip and I am glad to visit such a wonderful places.</p><h3 id="Describe-a-time-you-used-your-cellphone-smartphone-to-do-something-important"><a href="#Describe-a-time-you-used-your-cellphone-smartphone-to-do-something-important" class="headerlink" title="Describe a time you used your cellphone/smartphone to do something important"></a>Describe a time you used your cellphone/smartphone to do something important</h3><p><strong>You should say: What happened When it happened How important the cellphone/smartphone was And explain how you felt about the experience</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about my experience which happened in Tokyo, which is the capital of Japan.

For the middle-aged people, they can take photos of their products/creation, and make it into advertisements to increase the sale of them, which can help them earn more money. Some of them also like to tour all over the world and record the rare phenomenon. For the older people, photos taken by the cameras can remind them of the old memories. Cameras really make it efficient and accurate for people to record their own growth, which has changed the world positively.</p><h3 id="Describe-something-that-you-can’t-live-without-not-a-computer-phone"><a href="#Describe-something-that-you-can’t-live-without-not-a-computer-phone" class="headerlink" title="Describe something that you can’t live without (not a computer/phone)"></a>Describe something that you can’t live without (not a computer/phone)</h3><p><strong>You should say: What it is What you do with it How it helps you in your life And explain why you can’t live without it</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like about a thing that I can not live without, which is camera.

Last term, we were required to get school before 8, so I asked my father to send me to the school by car. It was at 7 o’clock that we got out from home. To my surprise, we encountered the morning peak. It was about 5 km from my home to my school. In the past, it only took us 20 min to get school by car. However, on that day, the car can only move at the speed of 10km/h. As we were stuck in the road, I was very anxious about whether I would be late for school, because I had never been late before. I could not do anything to deal with that phenomenon, so I took out my textbook to recite the English words. As time passed by, I recited 100 words during the time that I got trapped in the road. Fortunately, at ten minutes to 8, I arrived at the school. Although I felt nervous in the process, I felt fulfilled, because I got full use of that period of time.</p><h3 id="Describe-an-important-river-lake-in-your-country"><a href="#Describe-an-important-river-lake-in-your-country" class="headerlink" title="Describe an important river/lake in your country."></a>Describe an important river/lake in your country.</h3><p><strong>You should say: Where it is How big/long it is What it looks like And explain why it is important</strong></p><p><em>长江 flow from…to…, with the length of 4504km, shape like dragon, wind/creep along China,农业灌溉、饮用水资源，运输渠道，三峡，发电、蓄洪能力</em></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about the longest river in Asia, which is called yangtze river. Yangtze river flows from plateau of Tibet_(青藏高原)_ to its mouth on the east china sea, with the length of 6300km. it runs through 11 provinces from west to the east of china. Its shape looks like a dragon, creeping along China. As the longest river in asia, the Yangtze river is the main source of agricultural irrigation. The drinking water in china also relies on the Yangtze river. There are 56 reservoirs built along it. What’s more, the yangtze river is also one of the most important transport channels, which undertakes much water transport mission in china. The three gorges is also an important part of the ynagtze river. It consists of qutang, wuxia, xiling. And a dam was established on it in 1994, which uses the hydroenergy_(水能)_ of Yangtze river to generate electricity. In the rainy seasons during summer, it helps to transfer the flood water in surrounding areas into the sea, which shows its great flood storage capacity.</p><h3 id="Describe-a-time-when-you-organized-a-happy-event-successfully"><a href="#Describe-a-time-when-you-organized-a-happy-event-successfully" class="headerlink" title="Describe a time when you organized a happy event successfully"></a>Describe a time when you organized a happy event successfully</h3><p><strong>You should say: What the event was How you prepared for it Who helped you to organize it And explain why you think it was a successful event</strong></p><p><em>准备（预定地方，做蛋糕， 装饰），邀请朋友，通知，派对开始</em> </p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about an experience of preparing a birthday party for my friend Olivia, who was turning 18.

At that time, my family gathered together at lantern festival. And we had a big dinner in that evening, whose main course was sticky rice dumplings, as there is a custom in china that people should have sweet dumpling on lantern festival. It was very sticky, which was my first impression about sweet dumplings. But it was not only delicious/tasty, but also made us feel warm and happy because sweet dumpling has a similar pronunciation in Chinese to “Tuanyuan”, meaning reunion, which represents harmony and happiness for the family.</p><h3 id="Describe-an-interesting-song"><a href="#Describe-an-interesting-song" class="headerlink" title="Describe an interesting song"></a>Describe an interesting song</h3><p><strong>You should say: What the song is What story the song tells Whether the song is popular And explain why you think it is interesting</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about a song I heard in our last cultural festival.

This song mainly talks about the beautiful memories about the life, and the precious love happened in the youth.

At first, we talked some daily topics by using the new languages. Later, I told her that I would attend the IELTS examination and asked her to teach me some phrases about the academic topic. She also hold the charity sales in the neighborhood, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of us, in which I helped her to translate and talk about with others. It was also due to her charity sales that I practiced the translated skills between chinese and english, which also made me feel that she was a really socially responsible and caring person.
