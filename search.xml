It is a piece of clothes with some pictures shot by Charlie Zhou on it. Since Charlie always express his feelings in his lyrics, healing people‘s wounds with the power of love, he is one of Olivia’s favorite singers in China. Therefore, last year, when Olivia’s 17st birthday was coming, I decided to buy something meaningful for her as a birthday gift, I found an advertisement on the street which shows the clothes sold by Charlie. It was designed for charity purpose, which means that all the money he got by selling these piece of clothes would all be donated to the poverty-stricken areas. However, after I received the clothes, I found it has bad quality. Although it is for charity reason, I think it left a bad impression on me. I will not buy those products next time.</p><h2 id="Describe-a-piece-of-good-news-that-you-heard-about-someone-you-know-well"><a href="#Describe-a-piece-of-good-news-that-you-heard-about-someone-you-know-well" class="headerlink" title="Describe a piece of good news that you heard about someone you know well"></a>Describe a piece of good news that you heard about someone you know well</h2><p><strong>You should say<br>What it was<br>When you heard it<br>How you knew it<br>And explain how you felt about it</strong></p><p>I want to talk about a news about the well-known singer in China called Charlie Zhou, which said he donated up to 2 billion to the society. I learn about it on the social media where I follow him. He held a  charity concert, which he not only donated all the money he got by selling the concert tickets, but also donated a large amount of money himself to those underdeveloped areas, which made me feel that he was a really socially responsible and caring person. I listened to Charlie’s songs by chance. As a singer, he usually posts some videos of his singing songs. People who like him are mostly impressed by his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. He always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people’s wounds with the power of love. He also used to post videos about his charity concerts, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of his fans. </p><h2 id="Describe-a-time-when-someone-gave-you-something-that-you-really-wanted"><a href="#Describe-a-time-when-someone-gave-you-something-that-you-really-wanted" class="headerlink" title="Describe a time when someone gave you something that you really wanted"></a>Describe a time when someone gave you something that you really wanted</h2><p><strong>You should say:<br>What it was<br>When you received it<br>Who gave it to you<br>And explain why you wanted it so much</strong></p><p>I want to describe a piece of clothes which my friend Olivia gave me as a gift on my birthday last year. It is a piece of clothes with some pictures shot by Charlie Zhou on it. Since Charlie always express his feelings in his lyrics, healing people‘s wounds with the power of love, he is one of my favorite singers in China and Olivia also knows that. Therefore, last year, when my 17st birthday was coming, Olivia decided to buy something meaningful for me as a birthday gift. Although the piece of clothes have simple style and design, this clothing have special meaning, because Charlie designed it for charity purpose, which means that all the money he got by selling these piece of clothes would all be donated to the poverty-stricken areas. Charlie often spares no efforts in doing charity work, which also sets a good example for all of his fans including me. Thus, Olivia figure that the piece of clothes not only show my support and affection to Charlie, but also can represent my little contribution to the charity work.</p><h1 id="生日"><a href="#生日" class="headerlink" title="生日"></a>生日</h1><h2 id="Describe-a-disagreement-you-had-with-someone"><a href="#Describe-a-disagreement-you-had-with-someone" class="headerlink" title="Describe a disagreement you had with someone"></a>Describe a disagreement you had with someone</h2><p><strong>You should say:<br>Who you had the disagreement with<br>What the disagreement was<br>What happened<br>And explain how you felt about it</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about an experience that is a birthday party for my best friend Olivia, who was turning 18.

They also stuck some heart-shaped balloons on the walls as decoration. They called me and told me to go to the restaurant, but all of them hid behind the door. As soon as I entered the room and switched on the light, they all yelled happy birthday and letted me push the button on the cake, which let the money flew out into the sky.

The place where we go swimming the most is a big swimming pool that was recently built near our apartment. It has a really good location because it is next to the city center.

Last summer holiday, Olivia asked me to teach her swimming, so we went to the swimming pool. For the first stage of swimming, I taught her how to hold her breath under the water, and I would time one minute for the her. After she managed to do that, she was told to learn breast stroke, as this is the easiest one to learn. I asked her to lie on the ground first, and simulate&#x2F;imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, she could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, she needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. I first demostrated how to do that, which may set a good example for her, but I later threw her into the center of the swimming pool and asked her to swim back to the ground. As she still wanted to be alive, after a few minutes of practice, she managed this skill. With days of practice, she could swim faster and further. Even though the process was full of difficulties, she successfully mastered how to swim and I felt very proud of her.</p><h2 id="Describe-an-activity-you-enjoyed-in-your-free-time-when-you-were-young"><a href="#Describe-an-activity-you-enjoyed-in-your-free-time-when-you-were-young" class="headerlink" title="Describe an activity you enjoyed in your free time when you were young"></a>Describe an activity you enjoyed in your free time when you were young</h2><p><strong>You should say:<br>What is was<br>Where you did it<br>Who you did it with<br>And explain why you enjoyed it</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about swimming, which I really enjoyed when I was young.

Sticky rice dumplings are small balls made of sticky rice flour, typically with sweet fillings made from peanuts, sugar, red beans, and sesame. In the south of china, people also use meat as the filling for sticky rice dumplings. I tried this traditional food for the first time when I was 7. At that time, my family gathered together at lantern festival. And we had a big dinner in that evening, whose main course was sticky rice dumplings, as there is a custom in china that people should have sweet dumpling on lantern festival. It was very sticky, which was my first impression about sweet dumplings. But it was not only delicious&#x2F;tasty, but also made us feel warm and happy because sweet dumpling has a similar pronunciation in Chinese to “Tuanyuan”, meaning reunion, which represents harmony and happiness for the family.The spirits of the product is beautiful.</p><h2 id="Describe-a-historical-period-moment-you-would-like-to-learn-more-about"><a href="#Describe-a-historical-period-moment-you-would-like-to-learn-more-about" class="headerlink" title="Describe a historical period&#x2F;moment you would like to learn more about"></a>Describe a historical period&#x2F;moment you would like to learn more about</h2><p><strong>You should say:<br>What you are interested in<br>When it happened<br>What you know about it<br>And why you would like to learn more</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about the Qin Dynasty, which was the first dynasty of imperial China.

He sat the class of all over the China such as the construction of roads and the money to trade, he also built the Great Wall of China and stopped the war of China.  Besides that, the Qin Dynasty developped many technology as well, the china is famous even to the oversea at that time.

The camera is a device you can use to record the scenes into images. On my 17th birthday, my father give me a camera as a gift, which is my first camera. Because I enjoy experiencing the natrul scense, I often go out to wandering. After I got my camera, I tried to use it to take the beautiful plants, however, it always low resolution because of the wrong focus had been use, I tried to switch the focus but it is hard for me to control, after a long time practice, I can catch some beautiful picture. It is worth for me to learn the difficult device. There are a lot of things about the camera for me to learn, I will continue to tried to manage it in the future.</p>]]></content>

stay night UBW</p><h2 id="8-印象最深的一天"><a href="#8-印象最深的一天" class="headerlink" title="8.印象最深的一天"></a>8.印象最深的一天</h2><p>应该就是12月25日了，第一次在生日当天跟朋友出去@zbl，@CJY-chen，很开心，一起看了《阿凡达·水之道》，电影很好看</p><h1 id="三，展望"><a href="#三，展望" class="headerlink" title="三，展望"></a>三，展望</h1><p>接下来的一年希望自己能够快速适应留学的生活，学有所成<br>也感谢各位过去的陪伴和支持，祝各位新年快乐<br>祝高二的朋友们@墨辰明，@小澍，@瑶桑，@渡尘学考顺利<br>祝高三的朋友们以及四班的同学们高考顺利，考上心仪的大学<br>祝其他的朋友工作顺利，梦想成真</p>]]></content>

Speaking of how I knew him, I had to take a long-distance running test during my senior high. In order to pass the test, I started to practice every morning with my earphones on, and I listened to Charlie’s songs by chance. As a singer, he usually posts some videos of his singing songs. People who like him are mostly impressed by his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. He always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people’s wounds with the power of love. He also used to post videos about his charity concerts, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of his fans. It was also due to his charity concert that I followed him on social media, as he not only donated all the money he got by selling the concert tickets, but also donated a large amount of money himself to those underdeveloped areas, which made me feel that he was a really socially responsible and caring person.</p><h2 id="Describe-a-friend-you-like-to-talk-with"><a href="#Describe-a-friend-you-like-to-talk-with" class="headerlink" title="Describe a friend you like to talk with"></a>Describe a friend you like to talk with</h2><p><strong>You should say: Who he&#x2F;she is What you like to talk about Why you like to talk with him&#x2F;her And explain how you feel about him&#x2F;her</strong></p><p>I want to talk about one of my best friends called Olivia. Speaking of how I knew her, she is my classmate in senior high school, and we both are Charlie Zhou’s fans, who is a famous singer in China.  Therefore, when we are together, we tend to talk about Charlie, as we are mostly impressed his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. Once Charlie held a charity concert, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas. As his fans, we decided to go together. It was also due to that charity concert that Olivia became a close friend of mine. As I found that she not only attended this concert to support Charlie, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas. After that, I often hang out with her, going shopping or trying some tasty food together. Knowing that Olivia is a really socially responsible and caring person, I enjoy spending time with her.  </p><h1 id="地点"><a href="#地点" class="headerlink" title="地点"></a>地点</h1><h2 id="Describe-a-quiet-place-you-like-to-go"><a href="#Describe-a-quiet-place-you-like-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Describe a quiet place you like to go"></a>Describe a quiet place you like to go</h2><p><strong>You should say: Where it is How you knew it How often you go there What you do there And explain how you feel about the place</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about Tokyo, which is a quiet place worth to go although it is the capital of Japan. It was the summer holiday in 2019 that I went there for travelling. Among all the attractions I visited in Tokyo, the fuji mountain, which is located at the suburban area, left me a deep impression. Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. It was surprising that the deep forest had existed for up to thousands of years and every tree is tall and strong. After seeing many kinds of the rare plants, I thought the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live(habitat). I learn a lot of knowledge in this trip and I am glad to visit it again in the next year.</p><h2 id="Describe-a-special-day-out-that-cost-you-little-money-didn’t-cost-you-much"><a href="#Describe-a-special-day-out-that-cost-you-little-money-didn’t-cost-you-much" class="headerlink" title="Describe a special day out that cost you little money&#x2F;didn’t cost you much"></a>Describe a special day out that cost you little money&#x2F;didn’t cost you much</h2><p><strong>You should say: When the day was Where you went How much you spent And explain how you</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk a special day in Tokyo, which is the capital of Japan.

Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look with my best friend Olivia. Because we climbed the mountain to see the original forest in a hurry, so we did not have time to buy anything. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. We spend a long time to climb the fuji mountain. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. Both of us forgot to take the weight coats. We felt cold and even freezing at first, but after we walked for a long distance, we think the experience is value, the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live. We learn a lot of knowledge in this trip and the trip did not cost me too much as well.</p><h1 id="生日"><a href="#生日" class="headerlink" title="生日"></a>生日</h1><h2 id="Describe-an-important-event-you-celebrated"><a href="#Describe-an-important-event-you-celebrated" class="headerlink" title="Describe an important event you celebrated"></a>Describe an important event you celebrated</h2><p><strong>You should say: What the event was When it happened Who attended the event And explain how you feel about the event</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about an important event that is a birthday party for my best friend Olivia, who was turning 18. First, her friends and I booked a restaurant, deciding to take Olivia there and give her a surprise. Then, I advised to make a cake by ourselves, which would suit her taste. Following my advice, we went to a DIY workshop to learn the skill of baking a cake. After devoting a lot of efforts, we finally managed to make the cake, which was not only tasty but also had an adorable look. We also stuck some heart-shaped balloons on the walls as decoration. We called her and told her to go to the restaurant, but all of us hid behind the door.

For the first stage of swimming, my father taught me how to hold my breath under the water, and he would time one minute for me. After i managed to do that, i was told to learn breast stroke, as this is the easiest one to learn. He asked me to lie on the ground first, and simulate&#x2F;imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, i could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, I needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. My father first demostrated how to do that, which set a good example for me, but he later threw me into the center of the swimming pool and asked me to swim back to the ground. As i still wanted to be alive, after a few minutes of practice, i managed this skill. With days of practice, i could swim faster and further.

Therefore, since last semester, I began to study efficiently by using this method every week, which helped me save a lot of time and I can have more leisure time to do whatever I want.</p><h1 id="交通拥堵"><a href="#交通拥堵" class="headerlink" title="交通拥堵"></a>交通拥堵</h1><h2 id="Describe-a-time-when-you-were-stuck-in-a-traffic-jam"><a href="#Describe-a-time-when-you-were-stuck-in-a-traffic-jam" class="headerlink" title="Describe a time when you were stuck in a traffic jam"></a>Describe a time when you were stuck in a traffic jam</h2><p><strong>You should say: When it happened Where you were stuck What you did while waiting And explain how you felt in the traffic jam</strong></p><p><em>上学的路上，上学期7点，背单词，慌张、充实</em></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about a traffic congestion I met last semester, which was a sunny day in the mid-summer.

Speaking of how I knew him, I had to take a long-distance running test two years ago. In order to pass the test, I started to practice every morning with my earphones on, and I listened to Charlie’s songs by chance.

It was a model sports car of Lamborghini, which is painted red with a fair-shaped design. I could use a remote control to make it move or stop or turn to any directions. As it was a birthday gift that my mom bought me, I really cherished it. Every time when I came back home from the kindergarten, I would be excited to play with it, and I even brought it to my friends’ homes to make it compete with other toy cars they have. In terms of the reason why I played with it, I was lonely at that time, and this toy car could accompany me. My parents had to work around the clock, having no time to take care of me. When I saw my toy car, I felt like my parents were by my side. Therefore, in my mind, this toy car was not only my toy but also my close friend. I still keep it in my bedroom and I suppose I will never throw it away in the future.</p><h2 id="Describe-something-that-was-broken-in-your-home-and-then-repaired"><a href="#Describe-something-that-was-broken-in-your-home-and-then-repaired" class="headerlink" title="Describe something that was broken in your home and then repaired"></a>Describe something that was broken in your home and then repaired</h2><p><strong>You should say: What it is How it was broken How you got it repaired And how you felt about it</strong></p><p>Speaking of this topic, I would like about an experience that I repaired my camera.

Following the tutorials, I decided to use a new nails replace the broken one. First, I unscewed the broken nails and then I put the lens on the right place to suit the new nails. Finally, I screwed the new nails and all the things are done. I tried to test the camera again and it can work in the right way.
