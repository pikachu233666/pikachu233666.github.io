<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about a foreigner, who lives next to our family. Actually, I don’t know what job she is doing, but I followed her on the social media when she moved in. I noticed that she always speaks for the minorities on her social media. When she just moved in, she came and visited our family, she was very enthusiastic, and asked me to teach her Chinese, and she would teach me English, so we spent much time learning languages. She also used to hold charity sales in the neighborhood, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of us. It was also due to her charity sales that I really admire her contributions to the society, as she not only donated all the money she got by selling the products, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas, which made me feel that she was a really socially responsible and caring person. All of her caring behavior makes me get interested in her.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about an interesting discussion on my neighbor with my friend Olivia, which make her think it is important to have a neibor while she thought the neibor is unnecessary before. Actually, I don’t know what job my neibor is doing, but I followed her on the social media when she moved in. I noticed that she always speaks for the minorities on her social media. When she just moved in, she came and visited our family, she was very enthusiastic, and asked me to teach her Chinese, and she would teach me English, so we spent much time learning languages.

It was also due to her charity sales that I really admire her contributions to the society, as she not only donated all the money she got by selling the products, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas. Actually, I haven’t worked together with her before, but as she is such a caring person, and I am going to major in_(读……专业)_ computer science in my university, she is the best choice to do this kind of voluntary work.</p>

<p>I want to talk about a well-known singer in China called Charlie Zhou. Speaking of how I knew him, I had to take a long-distance running test two years ago. In order to pass the test, I started to practice every morning with my earphones on, and I listened to Charlie’s songs by chance. People who like him are mostly impressed by his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. As he is also a composer, he always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people ‘s wounds with the power of love. He also used to hold charity concerts, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of his fans.

Since Charlie always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people‘s wounds with the power of love, he is Olivia’s favorite singer in China. Olivia’s 17st birthday is coming, so I want to buy something meaningful for her as a birthday gift this year. Although this clothing has simple style and design, it has its special meaning, because Charlie designed it for charity purpose, which means that all the money he got by selling these calendars would all be donated to the poverty-stricken areas. Charlie often spares no efforts in doing charity work, which also sets a good example for all of his fans like Olivia. Thus, I figure that this clothing not only shows Olivia’s support and affection to Charlie, but also can represent her little contribution to the charity work.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about Tokyo, which is the capital of Japan. It was the summer holiday in 2019 that I went there for travelling. Among all the attractions I visited in Tokyo, the fuji mountain, which is located at the suburban area, left me a deep impression. Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. It was surprising that the deep forest had existed for up to thousands of years and every tree is tall and strong. After seeing many kinds of the rare plants, I thought the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live(habitat). I learn a lot of knowledge in this trip and I am glad to visit such a wonderful places.</p>

The apartment only needs to have one bedroom, but I hope that it can have a large desk for me to put three computer monitors, which will satisfy my requirement of programming. I also want to have a big balcony in my apartment so that I can spend time in the fresh air to keep healthy and have a pleasant mood. For the living room, it needs to have a treadmill and a television with big screen. As I prefer simple living environment, the overall style of decoration will tend to be concise_（简约的)_ and graceful. The apartment I just mentioned is just what I aspire, it can help me live a fulfilling life, and I will definitely feel delighted and comfortable to live in such an apartment.</p>

After i managed to do that, i was told to learn breast stroke, as this is the easiest one to learn. He asked me to lie on the ground first, and simulate/imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, i could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, I needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. My father first demostrated how to do that, which set a good example for me, but he later threw me into the center of the swimming pool and asked me to swim back to the ground. As i still wanted to be alive, after a few minutes of practice, i managed this skill. With days of practice, i could swim faster and further. Even though the process was full of difficulties, i sucessfully mastered how to swim and i felt very proud of myself.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about a experience I have realize. Because I watched a TV programme about swimming, I appeared a strong ambition to learning swimming, so I told my father to teach me about it. For the first stage of swimming, my father taught me how to hold my breath under the water, and he would time one minute for me. After i managed to do that, i was told to learn breast stroke, as this is the easiest one to learn. He asked me to lie on the ground first, and simulate/imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, i could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, I needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. My father first demostrated how to do that, which set a good example for me, but he later threw me into the center of the swimming pool and asked me to swim back to the ground. However, because of this is my first time to swim, i finally failed to swimming. Even though the process was full of difficulties, I believe if I work hard to practice, i will sucessfully master how to swim and i will achieve my ambition in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about the toy car my mom sent me as my birthday gift when I was 3 years old. It was a model sports car of Lamborghini, which is painted red with a fair-shaped design. I could use a remote control to make it move or stop or turn to any directions. As it was a birthday gift that my mom bought me, I really cherished it. Every time when I came back home from the kindergarten, I would be excited to play with it, and I even brought it to my friends’ homes to make it compete with other toy cars they have. In terms of the reason why I played with it, I was lonely at that time, and this toy car could accompany me. My parents had to work around the clock, having no time to take care of me. When I saw my toy car, I felt like my parents were by my side. Therefore, in my mind, this toy car was not only my toy but also my close friend. I still keep it in my bedroom and I suppose I will never throw it away in the future.</p>

Last month, when I climbed mountain in the morning at that day, my camera accidentally dropped down onto a stone. After I picked it up, I tried to opened the camera and press the button to test if the camera could still work well. Unfortunately, I found that the nails which connect the lens and camera is broken. I found the tutorial on the website and learnt how to fixed it on my own. To my surprise, the tutorials seems not only very simple but also economical for me. Following the tutorials, I decided to use a new nails replace the broken one. First, I unscewed the broken nails and then I put the lens on the right place to suit the new nails. Finally, I screwed the new nails and all the things are done. I tried to test the camera again and it can work in the right way. I was so proud of myself and happy to manage the skill of fix it.</p>

However, I am a kind of person who get used of making notes on my ipad, so this rule absolutely has certain impact to my study efficiency, as I have to take notes on paper first and then copy and save them again on my ipad. All the other students also complain about this rule, because they usually need to take a rest by looking at electronic devices after studying for a long time, and this rule makes it impossible. However, although I hate this rule, I still have followed it, because it cannot be denied否认 that this rule effectively protects the precious books, which are the important resources for all the students and teachers in our school.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about the thing I do to help me to be more concentrated, which is to go to the reading room without bringing electronic devices. Last year, when I prepared for my final exam, I felt time was not enough to review all the knowledge I have learnt during the whole semester/term, so I went to the reading room to study in order to prevent myself from being disturbed by noise. However, it didn’t have any effect at first, because I always focused on my phone instead of my schoolwork. When I noticed this, I thought the phone was the biggest distraction for me, so I decided not to bring any electronic devices to the reading room so that I can better concentrate on my study, and it turned out to be effective: it saved a lot of time to review the detailed knowledge for the exam, for example, I could only review one unit in one hour before, but since I did so, I could review more than three units in one hours. Therefore, since last semester, I began to study efficiently by using this method every week, which helped me save a lot of time and I can have more leisure time to do whatever I want.</p>

All people need to do is to point the lens to the things you want to catch and press the button, then people can get a clear picture of it. Nowadays, cameras are small and light that can be taken to anywhere easily, which allows people to record their lives whenever and wherever they want. For the young people, they can explore the world by using the camera to record the items they are interested in, which can increase their curiosity toward the world, stimulate their innovative spirit. For the middle-aged people, they can take photos of their products/creation, and make it into advertisements to increase the sale of them, which can help them earn more money. Some of them also like to tour all over the world and record the rare phenomenon. For the older people, photos taken by the cameras can remind them of the old memories. Cameras really make it efficient and accurate for people to record their own growth, which has changed the world positively.</p>

Last term, we were required to get school before 8, so I asked my father to send me to the school by car. It was at 7 o’clock that we got out from home. To my surprise, we encountered the morning peak. It was about 5 km from my home to my school. In the past, it only took us 20 min to get school by car. However, on that day, the car can only move at the speed of 10km/h. As we were stuck in the road, I was very anxious about whether I would be late for school, because I had never been late before. I could not do anything to deal with that phenomenon, so I took out my textbook to recite the English words. As time passed by, I recited 100 words during the time that I got trapped in the road. Fortunately, at ten minutes to 8, I arrived at the school. Although I felt nervous in the process, I felt fulfilled, because I got full use of that period of time.</p>

Yangtze river flows from plateau of Tibet_(青藏高原)_ to its mouth on the east china sea, with the length of 6300km. it runs through 11 provinces from west to the east of china. Its shape looks like a dragon, creeping along China. As the longest river in asia, the Yangtze river is the main source of agricultural irrigation. The drinking water in china also relies on the Yangtze river. There are 56 reservoirs built along it. What’s more, the yangtze river is also one of the most important transport channels, which undertakes much water transport mission in china. The three gorges is also an important part of the ynagtze river. It consists of qutang, wuxia, xiling. And a dam was established on it in 1994, which uses the hydroenergy_(水能)_ of Yangtze river to generate electricity. In the rainy seasons during summer, it helps to transfer the flood water in surrounding areas into the sea, which shows its great flood storage capacity.</p>

Sticky rice dumplings are small balls made of sticky rice flour, typically with sweet fillings made from peanuts, sugar, red beans, and sesame. In the south of china, people also use meat as the filling for sticky rice dumplings. I tried this traditional food for the first time when I was 7. At that time, my family gathered together at lantern festival. And we had a big dinner in that evening, whose main course was sticky rice dumplings, as there is a custom in china that people should have sweet dumpling on lantern festival. It was very sticky, which was my first impression about sweet dumplings. But it was not only delicious/tasty, but also made us feel warm and happy because sweet dumpling has a similar pronunciation in Chinese to “Tuanyuan”, meaning reunion, which represents harmony and happiness for the family.</p>

This song mainly talks about the beautiful memories about the life, and the precious love happened in the youth. However, the first time I was amazed by this song was at the cultural festival, as a foreign teacher was singing the adaptation version of this song. I was curious about this special adaptation, so I asked him. He said he changed some lyrics himself when he was learning chinese.<br>In terms of why I think this song is interesting, it was my first time to hear the adaptation version of a Chinese song, which integrates two different cultures together in such a proper way.</p>

When she just moved in, she came and visited our family, she was very enthusiastic, and asked me to teach her Chinese, and she would teach me English, so we spent much time learning languages. At first, we talked some daily topics by using the new languages. Later, I told her that I would attend the IELTS examination and asked her to teach me some phrases about the academic topic.
