<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about a party where I made a good friend. The party is held by my neighbor. Actually, I don’t know what job she is doing, but I followed her on the social media when she moved in. I noticed that she always speaks for the minorities on her social media. When she just moved in, she invited the people in our neighborhood came her home to have a party, she was very enthusiastic, her home is relatively small,seems concise and graceful, but just suitable for the reqirement of her life, she introduced many useful things in the party and sold it to us, which income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of us. It was also due to her party that I really admire her, as she not only donated all the money she got by selling the products, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas, which made me feel that she was a really socially responsible and caring person. I think she is a symble of the love and never forget it.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic,I want to talk about a foreigner, who lives next to our family last year. When she just moved in, she came and visited our family, she was very enthusiastic. In terms of what kind of work I want to do with her, I would like to open up a charity school together with her, as she is a really socially responsible and caring person. I noticed that she always speaks for the minorities on her social media. She also used to hold charity sales in the neighborhood, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of us. It was also due to her charity sales that I really admire her contributions to the society, as she not only donated all the money she got by selling the products, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas. Actually, I haven’t worked together with her before, but as she is such a caring person, and I am going to major in_(读……专业)_ computer science in my university, she is the best choice to do this kind of voluntary work.</p>

<p>I want to describe a piece of clothes which I saw the advertisement about it. It is a piece of clothes with some pictures shot by Charlie Zhou on it. Since Charlie always express his feelings in his lyrics, healing people‘s wounds with the power of love, he is one of Olivia’s favorite singers in China. Therefore, last year, when Olivia’s 17st birthday was coming, I decided to buy something meaningful for her as a birthday gift, I found an advertisement on the street which shows the clothes sold by Charlie. It was designed for charity purpose, which means that all the money he got by selling these piece of clothes would all be donated to the poverty-stricken areas. However, after I received the clothes, I found it has bad quality. Although it is for charity reason, I think it left a bad impression on me. I will not buy those products next time.</p>

He held a  charity concert, which he not only donated all the money he got by selling the concert tickets, but also donated a large amount of money himself to those underdeveloped areas, which made me feel that he was a really socially responsible and caring person. I listened to Charlie’s songs by chance. As a singer, he usually posts some videos of his singing songs. People who like him are mostly impressed by his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. He always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people’s wounds with the power of love. He also used to post videos about his charity concerts, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of his fans. </p>

Since Charlie always express his feelings in his lyrics, healing people‘s wounds with the power of love, he is one of my favorite singers in China and Olivia also knows that. Therefore, last year, when my 17st birthday was coming, Olivia decided to buy something meaningful for me as a birthday gift. Although the piece of clothes have simple style and design, this clothing have special meaning, because Charlie designed it for charity purpose, which means that all the money he got by selling these piece of clothes would all be donated to the poverty-stricken areas. Charlie often spares no efforts in doing charity work, which also sets a good example for all of his fans including me. Thus, Olivia figure that the piece of clothes not only show my support and affection to Charlie, but also can represent my little contribution to the charity work.</p>

But several months ago, She had to see a doctor for my back pain, which has already made her not able to concentrate on her work. Because of this, I started to persuade her to go swimming with me in our spare time. So, since then, She have been swimming with me. The place where we go swimming the most is a big swimming pool that was recently built near our apartment. It has a really good location because it is next to the city center. We usually go swimming there about two or three times a week. We also like to go to some other swimming pools to attend the swimming competition on weekends and challenge ourselves. Anyway, after three months, her back pain was cured gradually. Swimming is a very good work-out for her whole body. Now she is feeling much better, so she has also become more productive in work, saving much time for her to concentrate on her study. She think swimming is a great way of keeping fit for her.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about the an experience I teach my friend Olivia a skill, which is swimming last year. Last summer holiday, Olivia asked me to teach her swimming, so we went to the swimming pool. For the first stage of swimming, I taught her how to hold her breath under the water, and I would time one minute for the her. After she managed to do that, she was told to learn breast stroke, as this is the easiest one to learn. I asked her to lie on the ground first, and simulate/imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, she could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, she needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. I first demostrated how to do that, which may set a good example for her, but I later threw her into the center of the swimming pool and asked her to swim back to the ground. As she still wanted to be alive, after a few minutes of practice, she managed this skill. With days of practice, she could swim faster and further. Even though the process was full of difficulties, she successfully mastered how to swim and I felt very proud of her.</p>

<p>Speaking pf this topic, I want to talk about swimming, which I want to learn in the future. When I was in the senior high school, I seldom doing sports, as I always worried that exercising too often might take lots of time that could have be used to study. But several months ago, I had to see a doctor for my back pain, which has already made me not able to concentrate on my work. Because of this, my best friend, Olivia, started to persuade me to go swimming with her in our spare time. So she once took me to a swimming pool. The place where we went swimming the most is a big swimming pool that was recently built near our apartment. It has a really good location because it is next to the city center. She taught me swimming there, but I did not manage to learn that, so I think swimming is quite hard to learn. However, swimming is a great way of keeping fit for me. I want to learn it in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to describe a problem when I bought a piece of clothes, which I want to send to my friend Olivia as a gift. It is a special piece of clothes with some pictures shot by Charlie Zhou on it. Since Charlie always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people‘s wounds with the power of love, he is Olivia’s favorite singer in China. Olivia’s 17st birthday is coming, so I want to buy something meaningful for her as a birthday gift this year. The clothes started to sell on 9, so I set off to the store by 8. To my surprise, I encountered the morning peak. It was about 5 km from my home to the shop. In the past, it only took us 20 min to get there by car. However, on that day, the car can only move at the speed of 10km/h. As we were stuck in the road, I made a decision of waiting for the traffic jam resolved and I took out my textbook to recite the English words. As time passed by, I recited 100 words during the time that I got trapped in the road. Fortunately, at ten minutes to 9, I arrived. Although I felt nervous in the process, I bought the clothes at last.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about the decision I made that helps me save a lot of time, which is to go to the reading room without bringing electronic devices. Last year, when I prepared for my final exam, I went to the reading room to study in order to prevent myself from being disturbed by noise. However, it didn’t have any effect, because I always focused on my phone instead of my schoolwork. so I decided not to bring any electronic devices to the reading room so that I can better concentrate on my study. At first,it was hard to go to the reading room without my phone, because I often used it to receive messages and chat with my friends frequently. It took me a whole week to adapt/adjust to this change and it turned out to be effective, it saved a lot of time to review the detailed knowledge for the exam, for example, I could only review one unit in one hour before, but since I did so, I could review more than three units in one hours. Therefore, since last semester, I began to study efficiently by using this method every week, which helped me save a lot of time and I can have more leisure time to do whatever I want.</p>

However, when I went to the reading room, there are many people chatting there and it is too noisy to read books. I got distracted by the noise every time when I want to concentrate on my study. So I give a feedabck to the manager, after that, The reading room set a rule is that everyone are not allowed to chat in the reading room. If someone is found to chatting or speaking too loud, he will be fined <em>(罚款)</em>.  After that, I often went to the reading room to enjoy the great studying atmosphere.</p>

The books said it was warm at the bottom of mountain. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. It is surprising that the deep forest has existed for up to thousands of years and every tree is tall and strong. There are also many kinds of the rare plants,which make me think the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live(habitat).</p>

The director Robert Wise tried to use the music to tell the story and he succeed. After that, I always review the movie and listen to the music in it, it really suitable for me. The Maria’s song express the beautiful cities of Europe and the love between family members, touch my heart and provide a unforgettable trip.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about a traditional product in china which is called sticky rice dumplings or sweet dumplings. Sticky rice dumplings are small balls made of sticky rice flour, typically with sweet fillings made from peanuts, sugar, red beans, and sesame. In the south of china, people also use meat as the filling for sticky rice dumplings. I tried this traditional food for the first time when I was 7. At that time, my family gathered together at lantern festival. And we had a big dinner in that evening, whose main course was sticky rice dumplings, as there is a custom in china that people should have sweet dumpling on lantern festival. It was very sticky, which was my first impression about sweet dumplings. But it was not only delicious/tasty, but also made us feel warm and happy because sweet dumpling has a similar pronunciation in Chinese to “Tuanyuan”, meaning reunion, which represents harmony and happiness for the family.The spirits of the product is beautiful.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about the Qin Dynasty, which was the first dynasty of imperial China. It started at about 221 BC and falled at about 206 BC, I think the emperer of the Qin Dynasty, which called QINSHIHUANG in Chinese is interesting. He sat the class of all over the China such as the construction of roads and the money to trade, he also built the Great Wall of China and stopped the war of China.  Besides that, the Qin Dynasty developped many technology as well, the china is famous even to the oversea at that time. Because of the limited technology, the Qin Dynasty has many things we need to explore, I will continue to learn about it in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about the camera, which let me think it is difficult to use. The camera is a device you can use to record the scenes into images. On my 17th birthday, my father give me a camera as a gift, which is my first camera. Because I enjoy experiencing the natrul scense, I often go out to wandering. After I got my camera, I tried to use it to take the beautiful plants, however, it always low resolution because of the wrong focus had been use, I tried to switch the focus but it is hard for me to control, after a long time practice, I can catch some beautiful picture. It is worth for me to learn the difficult device. There are a lot of things about the camera for me to learn, I will continue to tried to manage it in the future.</p>
