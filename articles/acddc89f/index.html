<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about a foreigner, who lives next to our family. Actually, I don’t know what job she is doing, but I followed her on the social media when she moved in. I noticed that she always speaks for the minorities on her social media. When she just moved in, she came and visited our family, she was very enthusiastic, and asked me to teach her Chinese, and she would teach me English, so we spent much time learning languages. She also used to hold charity sales in the neighborhood, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of us. It was also due to her charity sales that I really admire her contributions to the society, as she not only donated all the money she got by selling the products, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas, which made me feel that she was a really socially responsible and caring person. All of her caring behavior makes me get interested in her.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about my sister, who is three-year older than me. In terms of what kind of work I want to do with her, I would like to open up a charity school together with her, as she is a really socially responsible and caring person. I noticed that she always speaks for the minorities on her social media. She also used to hold charity sales in the neighborhood, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of us. It was also due to her charity sales that I really admire her contributions to the society, as she not only donated all the money she got by selling the products, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas. Actually, I haven’t worked together with her before, but as she is such a caring person, and I am going to major in_(读……专业)_ computer science in my university, she is the best choice to do this kind of voluntary work.</p>

<p>I want to talk about a well-known singer in China called Charlie Zhou. Speaking of how I knew him, I had to take a long-distance running test during my senior high. In order to pass the test, I started to practice every morning with my earphones on, and I listened to Charlie’s songs by chance. As a singer, he usually posts some videos of his singing songs. People who like him are mostly impressed by his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. He always expresses his feelings in his lyrics, healing people’s wounds with the power of love. He also used to post videos about his charity concerts, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas, setting a good example for all of his fans.

Therefore, when we are together, we tend to talk about Charlie, as we are mostly impressed his magical voice between girl’s voice and child’s voice. Once Charlie held a charity concert, whose income was all donated to the poverty-stricken areas. As his fans, we decided to go together. It was also due to that charity concert that Olivia became a close friend of mine. As I found that she not only attended this concert to support Charlie, but also donated a large amount of money herself to those underdeveloped areas. After that, I often hang out with her, going shopping or trying some tasty food together. Knowing that Olivia is a really socially responsible and caring person, I enjoy spending time with her.  </p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about Tokyo, which is a quiet place worth to go although it is the capital of Japan. It was the summer holiday in 2019 that I went there for travelling. Among all the attractions I visited in Tokyo, the fuji mountain, which is located at the suburban area, left me a deep impression. Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. It was surprising that the deep forest had existed for up to thousands of years and every tree is tall and strong. After seeing many kinds of the rare plants, I thought the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live(habitat). I learn a lot of knowledge in this trip and I am glad to visit it again in the next year.</p>

We spend a long time to climb the fuji mountain. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing. Both of us forgot to take the weight coats. We felt cold and even freezing at first, but after we walked for a long distance, we think the experience is value, the deep forest is a treasure of the Earth and human beings, it not only provides fresh air for us, but also gives the animals a home to live. We learn a lot of knowledge in this trip and the trip did not cost me too much as well.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about the skill I learnt last year from my father, which is swimming. For the first stage of swimming, my father taught me how to hold my breath under the water, and he would time one minute for me. After i managed to do that, i was told to learn breast stroke, as this is the easiest one to learn. He asked me to lie on the ground first, and simulate/imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, i could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, I needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. My father first demostrated how to do that, which set a good example for me, but he later threw me into the center of the swimming pool and asked me to swim back to the ground. As i still wanted to be alive, after a few minutes of practice, i managed this skill. With days of practice, i could swim faster and further. Even though the process was full of difficulties, i sucessfully mastered how to swim and i felt very proud of myself. The skill can keep me fit and healthy and even can save me in emergency situation as well. </p>

Actually, I barely worked out before that, as I always worried that exercising too often might take lots of time that could have be used to study. But several months ago, I had to see a doctor for my back pain, which has already made me not able to concentrate on my work. Because of this, my best friend, Olivia, started to persuade me to go swimming with her in our spare time. So, since then, I have been swimming with Olivia. The place where we go swimming the most is a big swimming pool that was recently built near our apartment. It has a really good location because it is next to the city center. We usually go swimming there about two or three times a week. We also like to go to some other swimming pools to attend the swimming competition on weekends and challenge ourselves. Anyway, after three months, my back pain was cured gradually. Swimming is a very good work-out for my whole body. Now I’m feeling much better, so I’ve also become more productive in work, saving much time for me to concentrate on my study. In my views, the swimming pool is really a convenient and good place for me, I believe I will stick to go there to swimming in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking pf this topic, I want to talk about my best friend Olivia, who inspired me to start swimming from half a year ago. She is my classmate when I was in the senior high school. Actually, I barely worked out before that, as I always worried that exercising too often might take lots of time that could have be used to study. But several months ago, I had to see a doctor for my back pain, which has already made me not able to concentrate on my work. Because of this, my best friend, Olivia, started to persuade me to go swimming with her in our spare time. So, since then, I have been swimming with Olivia. The place where we go swimming the most is a big swimming pool that was recently built near our apartment. It has a really good location because it is next to the city center. We usually go swimming there about two or three times a week. We also like to go to some other swimming pools to attend the swimming competition on weekends and challenge ourselves. Anyway, after three months, my back pain was cured gradually. Swimming is a very good work-out for my whole body. Now I’m feeling much better, so I’ve also become more productive in work, saving much time for me to concentrate on my study. In my views, swimming is a great way of keeping fit for me. I believe I will stick to it in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about the thing I do to help me to be more concentrated, which is to go to the reading room without bringing electronic devices. Last year, when I prepared for my final exam, I felt time was not enough to review all the knowledge I have learnt during the whole semester/term, so I went to the reading room to study in order to prevent myself from being disturbed by noise. However, it didn’t have any effect at first, because I always focused on my phone instead of my schoolwork. When I noticed this, I thought the phone was the biggest distraction for me, so I decided not to bring any electronic devices to the reading room so that I can better concentrate on my study, and it turned out to be effective: it saved a lot of time to review the detailed knowledge for the exam, for example, I could only review one unit in one hour before, but since I did so, I could review more than three units in one hours. Therefore, since last semester, I began to study efficiently by using this method every week, which helped me save a lot of time and I can have more leisure time to do whatever I want.</p>

To solve this problem, my best friends Olivia gave me advice to let me go to the reading room. The reading room has a rule is that everyone are not allowed to bring any electronic devices into the reading room. If someone is found to bring them in, he will be fined <em>(罚款)</em>. The purpose of making this rule may be to protect the precious ancient books collected in it, and the university may also want us to concentrate on our study instead of electronic devices, which are the biggest distraction to study. Although I hate this rule at first, I still have followed it, because it cannot be denied否认 that this rule effectively improve my study.

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about a traffic congestion I met last semester, which was a sunny day in the mid-summer. Last term, we were required to get school before 8, so I asked my father to send me to the school by car. It was at 7 o’clock that we got out from home. To my surprise, we encountered the morning peak. It was about 5 km from my home to my school. In the past, it only took us 20 min to get school by car. However, on that day, the car can only move at the speed of 10km/h. As we were stuck in the road, I was very anxious about whether I would be late for school, because I had never been late before. I could not do anything to deal with that phenomenon, so I took out my textbook to recite the English words. As time passed by, I recited 100 words during the time that I got trapped in the road. Fortunately, at ten minutes to 8, I arrived at the school. Although I felt nervous in the process, I felt fulfilled, because I got full use of that period of time.</p>

Its shape looks like a dragon, creeping along China. As the longest river in asia, the Yangtze river is the main source of agricultural irrigation. The drinking water in china also relies on the Yangtze river. There are 56 reservoirs built along it. What’s more, the yangtze river is also one of the most important transport channels, which undertakes much water transport mission in china. The three gorges is also an important part of the ynagtze river. It consists of qutang, wuxia, xiling. And a dam was established on it in 1994, which uses the hydroenergy_(水能)_ of Yangtze river to generate electricity. In the rainy seasons during summer, it helps to transfer the flood water in surrounding areas into the sea, which shows its great flood storage capacity.</p>

It was very sticky, which was my first impression about sweet dumplings. But it was not only delicious/tasty, but also made us feel warm and happy because sweet dumpling has a similar pronunciation in Chinese to “Tuanyuan”, meaning reunion, which represents harmony and happiness for the family.</p>

It tells the story about Maria, who takes a job as a governess to a large family, she quickly falls in love with the children and their father, who is a captain, which is based on a real story.  Olivia and I watched the movie last month and we were both like the songs in it, which is the main part of the movie.

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about a competiton in swimming for the beginners which will be held next month in the sports center in Shenyang. This competiton aims to improve the skills of every competitors in swimming. To attend the competetion, I have to devote a large amount of the time to practice the swimming. I was told to learn breast strokeby my coach, as this is the easiest one to learn. He asked me to lie on the ground first, and simulate/imitate the action of a frog. After a few days, i could swim a few meters in the swimming pool at a time. To swim further, I needed to learn how to come out of the water like a frog to breathe while swimming, which is to inhale a large amount of air. The coach first demonstrated how to do that, which set a good example for me, after a few minutes of practice, i managed this skill. With days of practice, i could swim faster and further. Even though the process was full of difficulties, i sucessfully mastered how to swim and have confidence to attend the competetion which can enhance my ability to swimming.</p>

<p><em>相机，记录生活，和他人分享景色，留下美好的回忆，文字/画，无法传递给后代，不准确</em> </p>
<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about a fantastic invention that has changed the world, which is camera. The camera is a device you can use to record the scenes into images. All people need to do is to point the lens to the things you want to catch and press the button, then people can get a clear picture of it. Nowadays, cameras are small and light that can be taken to anywhere easily, which allows people to record their lives whenever and wherever they want. For the young people, they can explore the world by using the camera to record the items they are interested in, which can increase their curiosity toward the world, stimulate their innovative spirit. For the middle-aged people, they can take photos of their products/creation, and make it into advertisements to increase the sale of them, which can help them earn more money. Some of them also like to tour all over the world and record the rare phenomenon. For the older people, photos taken by the cameras can remind them of the old memories. Cameras really make it efficient and accurate for people to record their own growth, which has changed the world positively.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to live in a relatively small apartment in the future. As I am going to live alone, small apartment seems to be suitable for me, and the burden of housework will not be very heavy. I would like it to be located in the city center, since it will be convenient to go shopping to buy daily necessities. The apartment only needs to have one bedroom, but I hope that it can have a large desk for me to put three computer monitors, which will satisfy my requirement of programming. I also want to have a big balcony in my apartment so that I can spend time in the fresh air to keep healthy and have a pleasant mood. For the living room, it needs to have a treadmill and a television with big screen. As I prefer simple living environment, the overall style of decoration will tend to be concise_（简约的)_ and graceful. The apartment I just mentioned is just what I aspire, it can help me live a fulfilling life, and I will definitely feel delighted and comfortable to live in such an apartment.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I want to talk about my experience which happened in Tokyo, which is the capital of Japan. It was the summer holiday in 2019 that I went there for travelling. Among all the<br>attractions I visited in Tokyo, the fuji mountain, which is located at the suburban area, left me a deep impression. On the way to the fuji mountain, I did not know the way to get there because of I am a foreigner, so I used my phone to located where it is. With the help of the map on my phone, I eventually get there. Because of a lesson in which I learnt about the original forest and active volcano, I got a strong interest in how the original forest at the volcano is like, so I chose to visit the fuji mountain to have a look. When I arrived at the bottom of mountain, it was warm. However, as the altitude rises, the temperature will decrease, the top of the mountain was freezing, thanks to the tips on my phone, I prepared a clothes before climbing the fuji mountain. I thought the smartphone is a treasure of the era and human beings, it not only provides convenient service, but also gives us many useful information.</p>

<p>Speaking of this topic, I would like to talk about an experience that I lost an important thing, which is camera. The camera is a device you can use to record the scenes into images. All I need to do is to point the lens to the things I want to catch and press the button, then I can get a clear picture of it. Last month, when I climbed mountain in the morning at that day, my camera accidentally dropped down to the mountain. To find it, I went down to the bottom of mountain and walk around, but found nothing. So I called the keeper of the mountain to help me. After one day, They called me said that they found my camera with the lens broken. We thanked the keeper and repaired the camera. The data in camera records important memories of my growth, I really surprised I could find it again.</p>
